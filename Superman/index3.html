			Batman is the super-hero protector of Gotham City, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil and 
							strikes terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity, he assumes the alias of Bruce Wayne, 
							billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy; though "Bruce Wayne" is technically his real name, this Bruce Wayne is 
							a disguise--that of the man he would have been had his parents not been murdered before his eyes when he was no more than 
							a mere boy.
