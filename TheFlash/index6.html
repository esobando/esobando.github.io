		Powers and Abilities</b>	
		</font></div>
		<p align="left">
			Wally's primary superpower is his ability to control the speed with which his body vibrates and to move and think at super speed, which he uses primarily to run at 
			super-human velocities. This super speed is derived from his mainline-connection to the Speed Force: a vaguely defined extra-dimensional energy force from which most 
			speedster heroes gain their powers. Wally is considered the fastest Flash and is significantly faster than Barry Allen. While most to all speedsters can make a connection 
			and draw upon this force, West "mainlines" power from the Speed Force itself and cannot be cut off from the source. This connection to the Speed Force grants him unique 
			abilities that other speedsters lack, such as lending and taking speed (which manifests in different ways, ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others
			metabolisms and healing abilities, allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time), as well as absorbing kinetic energy in a less direct manner; 
			he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet Earth while standing at the North Pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earth
			quakes. Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy. Like all Flashes, Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist
			the heat created by the pressure of compressed air caused by moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities. It is not known
			how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment, but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows
			him to "side step" such environmental consequences. Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force, he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time with
			out needing rest or causing damage to his body. It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running, making it so he does not literally 
			feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed. Even so, he has a sped up metabolism and finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply
			the chemical energy needed. Using his abilities, Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water, create powerful vortices with his arms or body, and vibrate at such
			speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye. Wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them, passing his molecules through 
			the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he's vibrating through, however, Wally accidentally destabilizes whatever he passes through, causing it to explode. 
			While this has its drawbacks, Wally has learned to use this offensively in battle. In Rebirth 2016, this ability is improved, now Wally can vibrate through objects without causing 
			them to explode. Instead of using the cosmic treadmill as his uncle Barry, Wally can use his speed to travel through time. He also outran death to the edge of the universe
			and beyond, where death didn't even exist and continued to run to get Linda back. There was a comic named The Human Race in which Wally ran faster than instant teleportation, 
			Reaching Trans-Time Velocity. Flash vol 2 #177 had Wally outrun the gravitational pull of a black hole. Using Jessie Quick's speed formula combined with his speed steal, Wally 
			can temporally accelerate to the point where he escapes linear time, essentially allowing him to function like the chronokenetic Zoom. Wally's connection to the Speed Force 
			grants him low level electrokinetic abilities. He generates large amounts of lightning while moving at super speed, as well as whenever he is angered. On certain occasions, 
			Wally has been able to project arcs of Speed Force lightning, such as when he is lending speed, or when he was using the Speed Force to restore the memories of the Titans, 
			during DC Rebirth.. Wally West is the fastest Flash and is arguably the fastest being that has ever existed as said by Max Mercuryâ€”and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry 
			are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun death. Wally himself has made several references to be faster than Barry and having surpassed him. Wally is fast 
			enough to easily break all the speed barriers and even enter the Speed Force. Wally has, on several occasions, traveled much faster than light and entered and exited the Speed 
			Force by his own volition. He has shown that he can achieve practically any speed he wishes and that there are no limits to his speed. Some interpretations of Wally are shown as 
			having above average strength. On the Justice League episode "The Brave and the Bold Part 2", the gorilla Solovar tells Wally that he weighed around 400 lbs; Wally then proceeded
			to lift Solovar and run to safety. Wally is also a skilled science prodigy. In some versions, Wally uses these skills to recreate the accident that gave Barry his powers by himself, 
			granting himself his own powers. Like his mentor, Wally understands what his speed enables him to do, and uses his knowledge of physics to his advantage in battle. After his return 
			to the DC Universe, Wally is said to be even faster than before. Titans (2016) #5 issue, established that the Speed Force is inside Wally more than ever before. He now generates white 
			lightning, which combines all the colors of the Speed Force. He also created his new Flash suit out of pure Speed Force energy, a red and silver costume. Also in DC Rebirth, Wally 
			learned that he can sense when time has been manipulated, as well as listen to the Speed Force, which allows him to sense disruptions in the space-time continuum.
