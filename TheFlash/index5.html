			Barry Allen has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the Silver Age described as faster than the speed of thought. Flash #150, "straining 
			every muscle", he ran at ten times the speed of light. However, when he pushed himself further (during the Crisis on Infinite Earths) he appeared to waste away as he was 
			converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in Secret Origins Annual #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers. This was later 
			retconned in The Flash: Rebirth #1, where Barry stated that he "ran into the Speed Force", and that, "When he stopped the Anti-Monitor, when [he] ran into the "Speed 
			Force" and joined it, it was like shedding [his] identity." Allen possesses abilities that original Flash Jay Garrick has not always been able to duplicate, and most 
			notably the ability to "vibrate" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in time travel by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed 
			also allows him, in certain circumstances, to "vibrate" between dimensions. In Grant Morrison's Final Crisis, using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects 
			of the Anti-Life Equation upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of Darkseid's mind control. Barry's speed has numerous 
			secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can 
			channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding 
			amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to 
			telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through "speed-reading", he can absorb large amounts of information 
			into his short-term memory, which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work 
			to rebuild a destroyed apartment building. The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as 
			grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry 
			learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to 
			process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens. Barry also developed the ability 
			to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is 
			classified as a metahuman: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.
