		<strong align="right">Silver Age</strong>	
		<p align="left">
		    After achieving great success in 1956 in reviving the Golden Age character The Flash, DC editor Julius Schwartz 
		    looked toward recreating the Green Lantern from the Golden Age of Comic Books. Drawing from his love for science-fiction, 
		    Schwartz intended to show the new Green Lantern in a more modern light, enlisting writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane, who in 
		    1959 would reintroduce Green Lantern to the world in Showcase #22 (October 1959) by creating Hal Jordan. The character was a success, 
		    and it was quickly decided to follow up his three-issue run on Showcase with a self-titled series. Green Lantern #1 began in July–August 
		    1960 and would continue until #89 in April–May 1972.

		<strong align="right">Alliance with Sinestro</strong>
		<p align="left">
			After being stripped of his ring by the Corps, Hal returns home, resigned. In his Coast City apartment, Jordan is hounded by his landlord 
			for overdue rent. As he looks out the window, Hal notices a woman in the building across the street being threatened. He jumps out his seventh 
			story window, crashes through the window of the woman's apartment, and subdues her attacker. Only then does he look up to see the room filled with 
			a camera crew and realize that the woman and her attacker are actors. Sometime later, Carol arrives to bail Hal out of jail. She tells him it's time 
			to move on with his life and offers Hal a job at Ferris Aircraft. Thinking it over, Hal asks Carol out on a date. Later that night, Hal and Carol are 
			dining in a fancy restaurant. Hal tells Carol he will accept her offer for a job and then says he has something else to ask her: he needs her to co-sign 
			a car lease for him. Carol throws her drink in his face and stomps off. Hal chases after and tries to apologize, not realizing Carol was expecting a proposal. 
			Thoroughly mad, Carol drives off leaving Hal stranded in a growing rainstorm. Soaking wet, Hal finally arrives home only to find an eviction notice attached to 
			his apartment door. The night is not over, however, as Sinestro is waiting and offers Hal a chance to regain his ring.
			Despite Sinestro's offer, Hal attacks him but Sinestro easily subdues him. Sinestro says that Hal's life has been very difficult lately without his ring. 
			Then, Sinestro creates a ring and places it on Hal. Powered by the ring, Hal frees himself from the chains and blasts Sinestro with an energy beam. However, the 
			beam does not affect Sinestro. Confused, Hal asks what's wrong with the ring and Sinestro replies that there is nothing wrong with it. Since the ring was created 
			by Sinestro, he alone can control it. To prove his point to Hal, Sinestro powers down his ring and Hal falls to a rooftop. As he reactivates the ring, Sinestro proclaims 
			that Hal is his servant. Then, Hal hears emergency sirens and flies to see the problem, much to Sinestro's annoyance. Hal and Sinestro watch as a bridge is about to collapse. 
			Hal saves a woman, but Sinestro deactivates his ring and the woman falls into the water. Then, Sinestro fixes the entire bridge and saves all the victims, including the woman. 
			As Sinestro reactivates Hal's ring, Gorgor, a member of the Sinestro Corps and the one behind the bridge's collapse, attacks them. Sinestro fights Gorgor, proclaiming that all 
			the members of his Corps gave into their sadistic urges instead of obeying the code of conduct he created. Then, he kills Gorgor with a sword construct. Sinestro tells Hal that the 
			Sinestro Corps have enslaved Korugar and he will help him destroy them.
