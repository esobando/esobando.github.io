			Diana is depicted as a masterful athlete, acrobat, fighter and strategist, trained and experienced in many ancient and modern forms of armed and unarmed combat, 
			including exclusive Amazonian martial arts. In some versions, her mother trained her, as Wonder Girl, for a future career as Wonder Woman. From the beginning, 
			she is portrayed as highly skilled in using her Amazon bracelets to stop bullets and in wielding her golden lasso. Batman once called her the "best melee fighter in 
			the world".The modern version of the character is known to use lethal force when she deems it necessary. In the New 52 continuity, her superior combat skills are 
			the result of her Amazon training, as well as receiving further training from Ares, the God of War, himself, since as early as her childhood.The Golden Age Wonder Woman 
			also had knowledge in psychology, as did her Amazon sisters.

			Personality

		<p align="left">
			Princess Diana commands respect both as Wonder Woman and Diana Prince; her epithetical title – The Amazon Princess – illustrates the dichotomy of her character. 
			She is a powerful, strong-willed character who does not back down from a fight or a challenge. Yet, she is a diplomat who strongly "favors the pen", and a lover of 
			peace who would never seek to fight or escalate a conflict. She's simultaneously both the most fierce and most nurturing member of the Justice League; and her political 
			connections as a United Nations Honorary Ambassador and the ambassador of a warrior nation makes her an invaluable addition to the team. With her powerful abilities, 
			centuries of training and experienced at handling threats that range from petty crime to threats that are of a magical or supernatural nature, Diana is capable of 
			competing with nearly any hero or villain. Many writers have depicted Diana in different personalities and tone; between both of her diametric extremes; that of a 
			worldly warrior, a highly compassionate and calm ambassador, and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person, depending on the writer. What has remained constant, 
			and is a mainstay of the character, is her nurturing humanity: her overwhelming belief in love, empathy, compassion, and having a strong conscience. This trait had been 
			the reason for her induction into the Star Sapphires. Writer Gail Simone was applauded for her portrayal of Wonder Woman during her run on the series, with comic book 
			reviewer Dan Phillips of IGN noting that "she's molded Diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character." Actress Gal Gadot described Wonder Woman as "an idealist. 
			Experienced, super-confident. Open and sincere even in the midst of a gruesome, bloody conflict. Having many strengths and powers, but at the end of the day she's a 
			woman with a lot of emotional intelligence". In the Golden Age, Wonder Woman adhered to an Amazon code of helping any in need, even misogynistic people, and never 
			accepting a reward for saving someone; while conversely, the modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other 
			alternative, exemplified in the killing of Maxwell Lord in order to save Superman's life. The New 52 version of the character has been portrayed to be a younger, 
			more headstrong, loving, fierce and willful person. Brian Azzarello stated in a video interview with DC Comics that they're building a very "confident", "impulsive" and 
			"good-hearted" character in her. He referred to her trait of feeling compassion as both her strength and weakness. A distinctive trait of her characterization is a 
			group of signature mythological exclamations, such as "Great Aphrodite!" (historically the very first one), "Great Hera!", "Merciful Minerva!", and "Suffering Sappho!',
			some of which were contributed by Elizabeth Holloway Marston.

						Initially, Wonder Woman was an Amazon champion who wins the right to return Steve Trevor – a United States intelligence officer whose plane had crashed on the Amazons' isolated island homeland – to "Man's World" and to fight crime 
						and the evil of the Nazis. During this period, Wonder Woman joined the Justice Society of America as the team's secretary.
						The Earth Two Wonder Woman survived the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and went to live among the Pre-Crisis Gods of Mount Olympus along with husband, General Steve Trevor. When the Gods of Olpmpus and their separate native dimension 
						are seen after the Crisis, the Earth Two Wonder Woman and Trevor are no longer there, nor recalled by the Gods indicating that the Crisis affected all levels of reality, not just the physical world. Since the Crisis, she has been 
						seen mostly as a non-corporeal being except but for on a few occasions. Although Wonder Woman maintained a secret identity throughout most of her career, she later publicly revealed herself after marrying Steve Trevor. Wonder Woman's 
						first Golden Age appearance was in All-Star Comics #8, but her first appearance as Earth-Two specific character was in Flash (Volume 1) #129. This appearance is usually dismissed as a cameo though it is technically her first appearance 
						as the Wonder Woman of the Justice Society of Earth-Two. Her first full appearance as an elder member of the Justice Society was in The Flash #137. In the Pre-Crisis continuity, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor gave birth to a daughter named Hippolyta Trevor. 
						Hippolyta (Lyta for short) became a member of the Earth-Two super-hero team, Infinity, Inc. In the Post-Crisis continuity, the war-time Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor were rendered apocryphal and Lyta's parentage was retconned to include Helena Kosmatos, 
						the Golden Age Fury.

					Silver Age
					</font></b></strong></p>
			<p>
				During the Silver Age, under writer Robert Kanigher, Wonder Woman's origin was revamped, along with other characters'. The new origin story increased the character's 
				Hellenic and mythological roots: receiving the blessing of each deity in her crib, Diana is destined to become "beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, as strong as 
				Hercules, and as swift as Hermes." At the end of the 1960s, under the guidance of Mike Sekowsky, Wonder Woman surrendered her powers in order to remain in Man's 
				World rather than accompany her fellow Amazons to another dimension. Wonder Woman begins using the alias Diana Prince and opens a mod boutique. She acquires a Chinese 
				mentor named I Ching, who teaches Diana martial arts and weapons skills. Using her fighting skill instead of her powers, Diana engaged in adventures that encompassed 
				a variety of genres, from espionage to mythology. This phase of her story was directly influenced by the British spy thriller The Avengers and Diana Rigg's portrayal 
				of Emma Peel.

				As Diana Prince, Wonder Woman is a legal citizen of the United States with no criminal record. On Paradise Island, Diana is a recognized member of the royal family. DC 
				Comics has never established an official first appearance of the Earth-One Wonder Woman. However, Wonder Woman (Volume 1) #98 provides Diana with a revised origin as well 
				as new powers such as her ability to glide on air currents. The same issue re-introduces Diana's mother, Hippolyta, this time with a mane of golden hair, as opposed to the 
				dark brown tresses of her Golden Age years. It is reasonable to presume that this issue firmly establishes the introduction of the modernized Pre-Crisis, Earth-One Wonder 
				Woman. The I Ching era period of the comic book has its supporters and its detractors. Some critics welcomed the change from campy super-heroics to more serious, 
				"topical" storytelling in the wake of the Batman TV series. Others felt that the comic had abandoned its history. Storylines included secret agent-style plots, as 
				well as some occult tales. One controversial cover showed Diana Prince brandishing a machine gun and firing at an airplane; contrary to the traditional depiction of 
				Wonder Woman, the updated version of Diana Prince was not against killing in order to defend herself or others. The revised series attracted some writers not normally 
				associated with comic books, most notably science fiction author Samuel R. Delany, who wrote two issues. Part of the credit for the revival of Wonder Woman as a 
				superhero was due to a campaign in which feminist Gloria Steinem - who was offended to see the most famous female superhero depowered—had a hand. The 1972 first 
				issue of Steinem's Ms. Magazine featured Wonder Woman in her 1940s costume on the cover, and contained an essay in appreciation of the character. Ironically, the 
				change in format was originally an acknowledgment of the Women's liberation movement. The I Ching era, despite the controversy, would continue to resonate for some 
				years to come, both in the comic book and in live action adaptations of Wonder Woman a few years later. The 1974 Cathy Lee Crosby telefilm, and the second and third 
				seasons of Lynda Carter's popular series (see below), would borrow heavily from the characterization of Diana Prince in the early 1970s.
