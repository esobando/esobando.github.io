                            Development for a live action Wonder Woman feature film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman 
                            attached as producer and possible director. In 1999 the project became attached to Jon Cohen, 
                            who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver, with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star. 
                            By 2001, Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay, with Silver Pictures backing the project. 
                            At that time, performers such as Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta-Jones were also rumored to be 
                            possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman. Leonard Goldberg focused on Bullock who said that 
                            she was approached for the role. Lucy Lawless, the star of Xena: Warrior Princess, was also under 
                            consideration, though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was 
                            portrayed as a "flawed hero". The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott, Cohen, 
                            Becky Johnston, and Philip Levens, and by August 2003, Levens had been replaced by screenwriter 
                            Laeta Kalogridis. In March 2005, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would 
                            write and direct the film. Early drafts of his screenplay included Steve Trevor as the narrator, a 
                            fierce battle between Diana and her mother over Trevor's welfare, and after leaving Themyscira, his 
                            need to frequently rescue a Diana rendered helpless by the modern world. Whedon was not able to 
                            complete a final version of his screenplay, and left the project in 2007. Although Whedon stated in 
                            May 2005 that he would not cast the part of Wonder Woman until he finished the script, Kate Beckinsale 
                            was linked to the part. In 2010, Whedon admitted that he did have an actress in mind for the part, 
                            stating that "Wonder Woman was basically Angelina Jolie." A day before Whedon's departure from 
                            Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures purchased a spec script for the film written by 
                            Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland. Set during World War II, the script impressed executives at 
                            Silver Pictures. However, Silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want 
                            the rights reverting; while stating the script had good ideas, Silver did not want the film to be a 
                            period piece. By April 2008, Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new script set in 
                            contemporary times that would not depict Wonder Woman's origin, but explore Paradise Island's 
                            history.
