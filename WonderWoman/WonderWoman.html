                            Development for a live action Wonder Woman feature film began in 1996, with Ivan Reitman 
                            attached as producer and possible director. In 1999 the project became attached to Jon Cohen, 
                            who adapted Wonder Woman for producer Joel Silver, with the hope that Sandra Bullock would star. 
                            By 2001, Todd Alcott was hired to write the screenplay, with Silver Pictures backing the project. 
                            At that time, performers such as Mariah Carey and Catherine Zeta-Jones were also rumored to be 
                            possible candidates for the role of Wonder Woman. Leonard Goldberg focused on Bullock who said that 
                            she was approached for the role. Lucy Lawless, the star of Xena: Warrior Princess, was also under 
                            consideration, though she stated that she would have been more interested if Wonder Woman was 
                            portrayed as a "flawed hero". The screenplay went through various drafts written by Alcott, Cohen, 
                            Becky Johnston, and Philip Levens, and by August 2003, Levens had been replaced by screenwriter 
                            Laeta Kalogridis. In March 2005, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would 
                            write and direct the film. Early drafts of his screenplay included Steve Trevor as the narrator, a 
                            fierce battle between Diana and her mother over Trevor's welfare, and after leaving Themyscira, his 
                            need to frequently rescue a Diana rendered helpless by the modern world. Whedon was not able to 
                            complete a final version of his screenplay, and left the project in 2007. Although Whedon stated in 
                            May 2005 that he would not cast the part of Wonder Woman until he finished the script, Kate Beckinsale 
                            was linked to the part. In 2010, Whedon admitted that he did have an actress in mind for the part, 
                            stating that "Wonder Woman was basically Angelina Jolie." A day before Whedon's departure from 
                            Wonder Woman, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures purchased a spec script for the film written by 
                            Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland. Set during World War II, the script impressed executives at 
                            Silver Pictures. However, Silver stated that he had purchased the script because he did not want 
                            the rights reverting; while stating the script had good ideas, Silver did not want the film to be a 
                            period piece. By April 2008, Silver hired Jennison and Strickland to write a new script set in 
                            contemporary times that would not depict Wonder Woman's origin, but explore Paradise Island's 
                            history.
                            In 2010, Warner Bros. stated that a Wonder Woman film was in development, along with films based on 
                            DC Comics superheroes the Flash and Aquaman. Both Wonder Woman and Aquaman were still under consideration 
                            for solo film subjects as of June 2013. DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson said Wonder Woman "has 
                            been, since I started, one of the top three priorities for DC and for Warner Bros. We are still trying 
                            right now, but she's tricky." On October 5, 2013, WB chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara said he wanted to 
                            get Wonder Woman in a film or on TV. Shortly afterward, Paul Feig said he had pitched the studio an idea 
                            for Wonder Woman as an action-comedy film. The studio then began to search for female directors to direct 
                            the film. While Michelle MacLaren was the studio's initial choice to direct (and while she initially 
                            indicated interest), she eventually left the project due to creative differences. In 2015, Patty Jenkins accepted 
                            an offer to direct Wonder Woman,based on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg and a story co-written by Heinberg, Zack Snyder,
                            Geoff Johns and Jason Fuchs. Of this version, Gadot stated that, for a long time, people didn't know how to approach the 
                            story. When Patty and I had our creative conversations about the character, we realized that Diana can still be a normal 
                            woman, one with very high values, but still a woman. She can be sensitive. She is smart and independent and emotional. She can 
                            be confused. She can lose her confidence. She can have confidence. She is everything. She has a human heart. This version was 
                            conceived of as a prequel to the first live-action, theatrical appearance of Wonder Woman, in the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, 
                            placing Wonder Woman in the 1910s and World War I (a decision which differs from her comic book origins as a supporter of the Allies during World War II).
                            As for story development, Jenkins credits the stories by the character's creator William Moulton Marston in the 1940s and George Perez's seminal stories in the 
                            1980s in which he modernized the character. In addition, it follows some aspects of DC Comics' origin changes in The New 52 reboot, where Diana is the daughter of Zeus. 
                            Jenkins cited Richard Donner's Superman as an inspiration.

                            Gal Gadot, who had originally signed for three feature films with Wonder Woman being her second, 
                            had extended her contract beyond that. The director of the first film, Patty Jenkins, who was 
                            initially signed for only one film, had expressed interest in returning to direct the sequel. 
                            In June 2017, during an interview with Variety, comic book writer Geoff Johns revealed that he and 
                            Jenkins had started writing the treatment for a Wonder Woman sequel and that he had a "cool idea 
                            for the second one". While speaking in a Q&A at Women in Film screening of the film, Jenkins 
                            confirmed she would indeed direct the sequel. However, Jenkins later tweeted that "it wasn't a 
                            confirmation. Just talking about ideas and hopes". On July 22, 2017, at San Diego Comic-Con, the 
                            studio officially announced a sequel would be produced, with Jenkins returning as director; its 
                            title was listed as Wonder Woman 2. In September 2017, it was officially confirmed that Jenkins 
                            would be directing the sequel. On September 13, 2017, it was reported that The Expendables' writer 
                            David Callaham would join the film to write the script along with Jenkins and Johns, who were 
                            already working on it for several months. On February 28, 2018, it was reported that the film would 
                            be shot with IMAX film cameras in select action sequences. By late May 2018, long-time DCEU 
                            producer Zack Snyder confirmed on social media platform Vero that he, along with his wife Deborah 
                            Snyder, would serve as producers on the Wonder Woman sequel. On June 13, 2018, the title of the 
                            film was announced to be Wonder Woman 1984. A source close to Jenkins described it as a stand-alone 
                            film "in the same way that Indiana Jones or [James] Bond films are, instead of one continuous story
                            that requires many installments." Principal photography began on June 13, 2018, under the working title Magic Hour.
                            Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England, and at a number of locations around the District of 
                            Columbia and Northern Virginia in the United States, including the Landmark Mall in Alexandria, Virginia and Georgetown 
                            during June and July 2018, with scenes shot in Alexandria from June 18 through July 14. Filming occurred outside the 
                            U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., during mid-June. Other filming locations around D.C. included the Penn Quarter 
                            neighborhood, McPherson Square, the DAR Constitution Hall near the White House, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden 
                            (Smithsonian), and the Lincoln Memorial. By mid-July, production in the United States was completed and moved to England. 
                            In August, filming on location took place in several places around London, including St. Andrew's Place, Regent's Park and 
                            the Royal College of Physicians. Between September and October 2018, production also took place at Almería, in Andalusia, 
                            southern Spain, as well as Fuerteventura and Tenerife in the Canary Islands. From September 5 to 11, filming occurred at 
                            the Alcazaba of Almería fortified complex and the Wall of Jayran in Almería. Production moved to Fuerteventura from 
                            September 13 through September 26, with the Corralejo Dunes National Park, Parque Holandés, El Jablito, La Oliva and the 
                            Jandía Natural Park as filming locations. Filming in Tenerife began during the last week of September, lasting two weeks 
                            at various different locations on the island. Production went back to England in October, with shooting on location taking place at the 
                            Imperial War Museum in Duxford, and Hyde Park and the Savoy Hotel in Central London.[56] By the end of the month, filming 
                            occurred at Torrington Square, adjacent to Birkbeck, University of London. By mid-November 2018, Pedro Pascal finished 
                            filming his scenes. Principal photography was completed on December 22, 2018, after a six-month shoot. Additional photography
                            began on July 28, 2019, in London at Warner Bros. Studios
