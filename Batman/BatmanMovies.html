		William Dozier wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed Batman TV series by having the feature in theaters while the 
		first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, 20th Century Fox, refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a 
		movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).

        The film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer Lorenzo Semple, Jr. and directed by Leslie H. Martinson. Martinson 
		had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't".
		
		<br></br>
		Ostensibly a crime series, the style of the show was in fact campy and tongue-in-cheek. It was a true situation comedy, in that situations were 
		exaggerated and were generally played for laughs. This increased as the seasons progressed, with the addition of ever greater absurdity. The characters, 
		however, always took the absurd situations extremely seriously – which added to the comedy.The series focused on the adventures of Batman and Robin. 
		Although the lives of their alter-egos, millionaire Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson, were frequently shown, it was usually only briefly, in the 
		context of their being called away on superhero business, or in circumstances where they needed to employ their secret identities to assist in their 
		crime-fighting. The "Dynamic Duo" typically come to the aid of the Gotham City Police upon the latter being stumped by a supervillain. Throughout each 
		episode, Batman and Robin have to follow a series of (wildly improbable) clues to discover the supervillain's plan, then figure out how to thwart that 
		plan and capture the criminal. For the first two seasons, Batman aired twice a week on consecutive nights. Every story is a two-parter, except for two 
		three-parters featuring villainous team ups (The Joker and The Penguin, The Penguin and Marsha, Queen of Diamonds) in the second season. The titles of 
		each multi-part story usually rhymed. For the third season, which aired once a week, most episodes were self-contained stories. 
		The cliffhangers between multiple-parters typically consisted of the supervillain holding someone captive, usually the Dynamic Duo, with the captives 
		being subject to some elaborate, gruesome – if unlikely – death. This would inevitably be resolved early in the follow-up episode.

		Tim Burton took over as director of the first Batman film in 1986. Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote 
		film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role 
		of Batman before Michael Keaton was cast. Keaton was a controversial choice for the role since, by 1988, he had become typecast 
		as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role. Jack Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker 
		under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the box office profits and his shooting schedule. Nicholson's final 
		salary is reported to be as high as $50 million. Principal photography took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 
		to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm 
		to drop out. Rewrites were performed by Warren Skaaren, Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems. Batman received positive reviews, broke 
		numerous box office records, and won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The film grossed over $400 million, and left a legacy over 
		the modern perception of the superhero film genre. Burton originally did not want to direct a sequel because of his mixed emotions over the 
		previous film. Sam Hamm's first script had Penguin and Catwoman searching for hidden treasure. Daniel Waters delivered a script that 
		satisfied Burton, which convinced him to direct the film. Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite, deleting characterizations of Harvey Dent 
		and Robin and rewriting the climax. Various A-list actresses lobbied hard for the role of Catwoman before Michelle Pfeiffer was cast, 
		while Danny DeVito signed on to portray the Penguin. Filming started at Warner Bros. in Burbank, California in June 1991. Batman Returns 
		was released with financial success, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with the film's box office run because it earned less than its predecessor.
		 However, Batman Returns was released to generally positive reviews, although a "parental backlash" criticized the film for containing violence 
		and sexual innuendos that were thought to be unsuitable for children. McDonald's shut down its Happy Meal tie-in for Batman Returns.
		<br></br>
		After the success of Batman, Warner Bros. was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at Pinewood Studios. They spent $250,000 storing the sets 
		from the first film. Tim Burton originally did not want to direct another film in the franchise. "I will return if the sequel offers something new and 
		exciting", he said in 1989. "Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea." Burton decided to direct Edward Scissorhands for 20th Century Fox. Meanwhile, Sam Hamm from the 
		previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while Bob Kane was brought back as a creative consultant. Hamm's script had Penguin and 
		Catwoman going after hidden treasure.

		fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the 
		script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, 
		which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one 
		scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." In early 
		scripts Max Shreck was the "golden boy" of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the 
		Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu. and Catwoman going 
		after hidden treasure.

	Batman Returns was released in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. 
	was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. Director Tim Burton was asked 
	to restrict himself to the role of producer, with approval of Joel Schumacher as director and the husband and wife 
	screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that "the key element to Batman is his duality. 
	And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne". Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat 
	accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher 
	felt it could be "lightened down". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of 
	Frank Miller's Batman: Year One. Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, 
	though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's childhood with some events of the comic 
	The Dark Knight Returns. Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Schumacher on The Client, was brought in to rewrite the script. 
	Burton, who was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was taken aback by some of the focus group meetings 
	for Batman Forever, a title which he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio's aim in making a film for 
	the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal. Production went on fast track with Rene Russo cast as Dr. Chase Meridian 
	but Michael Keaton decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in. 
	Keaton also wanted to pursue "more interesting roles", turning down $15 million. A decision was made to go with a younger 
	actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to Ethan Hawke, who turned it down. Schumacher had seen Val Kilmer in 
	Tombstone, but was also interested in Daniel Day-Lewis, Ralph Fiennes, William Baldwin and Johnny Depp. Kilmer signed on 
	without reading the script or knowing who the new director was. With Kilmer's casting, Warner Bros. dropped Rene Russo as 
	Chase Meridian. Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton were all being considered the role was recast 
	with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams took on the role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying 
	Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. 
	Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions 
	to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, 
	but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted 
	due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided 
	to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to go the role after a meeting 
	with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create 
	a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.

	With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired 
	director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best 
	to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. 
	Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. 
	The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. 
	Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode "Heart of Ice", written by 
	Paul Dini. While Chris O'Donnell reprises the role of Robin, Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role of Batman from 
	Batman Forever. Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on Forever. "He sort of quit," Schumacher said, 
	"and we sort of fired him." Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast track production and was already committed to The 
	Saint (1997). Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place, but George Clooney 
	was cast instead. Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton 
	(in Batman and Batman Returns) and Kilmer. The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on ER without any 
	scheduling conflicts. Patrick Stewart was considered for the role of Mr. Freeze, before the script was rewritten to 
	accommodate Arnold Schwarzenegger's casting. Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be "big and strong like he was 
	chiseled out of a glacier". Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role. His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe 
	took six hours to apply each day. Thurman took the role of Poison Ivy because she liked the femme fatale characterization 
	of the character. Alicia Silverstone was the only choice for the role of Batgirl. According to Schumacher, during the scene 
	in which the costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he originally planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping 
	from Arkham Asylum while many other villains saw them from their cells. The scene, however, didn't make it in the final film.

		In January 2003, Warner Bros. hired Memento director Christopher Nolan to direct an untitled Batman film, and David S. Goyer signed on to write the 
		script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by "doing the origins story of the character, which is a 
		story that's never been told before". Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that "the world of Batman is that 
		of grounded reality. It will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises." Goyer said that the goal of 
		the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and 
		described his inspiration as being Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character's growth. Also similar to Superman, 
		Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story. Nolan's personal "jumping off point" 
		of inspiration was "The Man Who Falls", a short story by Denny O'Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in 
		Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from "The Man Who Falls". Batman: The Long Halloween, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn 
		by Tim Sale, influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from Halloween's 
		"sober, serious approach". The writers considered having Harvey Dent in the film, but replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they 
		realized they "couldn't do him justice". The character was later portrayed by Aaron Eckhart in the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight. The sequel to Halloween, 
		Batman: Dark Victory, also served as a minor influence. Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne's multi-year absence presented in Batman: Year One to help 
		set up some of the film's events in the transpiring years. In addition, the film's Sergeant James Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen 
		in Year One. The writers of Batman Begins also used Frank Miller's Year One plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and 
		Gotham City's need for Batman.A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained 
		that by ignoring that idea which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that 
		becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of 
		his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different. At his audition, Bale wore the bat suit (minus 
		the cape which has been missing for some time) Val Kilmer donned for 1995's Batman Forever.
		<br></br>
		Before the release of Batman Begins, screenwriter David S. Goyer wrote a treatment for two sequels which introduced the Joker and Harvey Dent. His 
		original intent was for the Joker to scar Dent during the Joker's trial in the third film, turning Dent into Two-Face. Goyer, who penned the first 
		draft of the film, cited the DC Comics 13-issue comic book limited series Batman: The Long Halloween as the major influence on his storyline. According 
		to veteran Batman artist Neal Adams, he met with David Goyer in Los Angeles, and the story would eventually look to Adams and writer Denny O'Neil's 1971 
		story "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" that appeared in Batman #251, in which O'Neil and Adams re-introduced the Joker. While initially uncertain of 
		whether or not he would return to direct the sequel, Nolan did want to reinterpret the Joker on screen. On July 31, 2006, Warner Bros. officially 
		announced initiation of production for the sequel to Batman Begins titled The Dark Knight; it is the first live-action Batman film without the word 
		"Batman" in its title, which Bale noted as signaling that "this take on Batman of mine and Chris' is very different from any of the others".
		After much research, Nolan's brother and co-writer, Jonathan, suggested the Joker's first two appearances, published in the first issue of Batman (
		1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker,
		with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics.Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as "essential research for anyone attempting to write a 
		supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth 
		origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, "the Joker we meet 
		in The Dark Knight is fully formed ... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him – maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably 
		dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." Nolan reiterated to IGN, "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," because 
		"the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important 
		element, but we wanted to deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." Nolan suggested Batman: The Killing Joke influenced a section of
		the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as "sort of an 
		inspiration" for his aim "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": "If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of 
		weight and breadth and depth in there. So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a 
		city is bound together."
		According to Nolan, an important theme of the sequel is "escalation", extending the ending of Batman Begins, noting "things having to get worse before 
		they get better". While indicating The Dark Knight would continue the themes of Batman Begins, including justice vs. revenge and Bruce Wayne's issues 
		with his father, Nolan emphasized the sequel would also portray Wayne more as a detective, an aspect of his character not fully developed in Batman Begins. 
		Nolan described the friendly rivalry between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent as the "backbone" of the film. He also chose to compress the overall storyline, 
		allowing Dent to become Two-Face in The Dark Knight, thus giving the film an emotional arc the unsympathetic Joker could not offer. Nolan acknowledged 
		the title was not only a reference to Batman, but also the fallen "white knight" Harvey Dent.
		<br></br>
		
		Warner Bros. president of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film would be released in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third 
		installment to keep him emotionally invested. "On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question," he reasoned, "how many good third movies in a 
		franchise can people name?" Nolan said that he never even thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark 
		Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through 
		production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to 
		Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and 
		Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.
		Following the success of the Joker in The Dark Knight, studio executives wished for the Riddler to be included as the primary villain as he was 
		considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, Nolan wanted the antagonist to be vastly different from the 
		previous incarnations and committed to using Bane instead, citing the need for a character with a physical presence within the film. He was initially 
		unfamiliar with the character's back-story, but pointed out the appeal of an archetype, labelling it as "the extreme of some type of villainy". When 
		comparing the choice of Bane with the Joker, Nolan highlighted the Joker as an example of "diabolical, chaotic anarchy and has a devilish sense of humor"
		, juxtaposing him against Bane, whom he likened to "a classic movie monster [...] with a terrific brain." Nolan has said that his draft of the script was 
		inspired by Charles Dickens' 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, which centers around the French Revolution. This homage to Dickens was briefly illustrated by 
		having Bane inconspicuously finger knit paracord in the film, symbolizing his literary character Madame Defarge, and more overtly by Commissioner Gordon's eulogy 
		for Bruce Wayne at the end of the film, which is taken directly from the classic book.
		It was not until February 9, 2010, that it was announced that Nolan had "cracked" the story of a sequel to The Dark Knight and was committed to return 
		to the project. Shortly afterward, it was announced David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan were working on a screenplay. Goyer would leave the project during 
		pre-production to begin work on Man of Steel; Jonathan continued writing the script based on the story by his brother Chris and Goyer. Chris Nolan said 
		that his brother's original draft was about 400 pages. The film's storyline has been compared with the Batman comic book series' story arc "Knightfall" 
		(1993), which showcased Bane; the mini-series The Dark Knight Returns (1986), in which Batman returns to Gotham City after a ten-year absence; and the 
		story arc "No Man's Land" (1999), which depicts a Gotham cut off from the rest of the world and overrun by gangs. The nickname "the Dark Knight" was 
		first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger. Nolan confirmed the Joker would not return in the third film, and 
		dismissed rumors that he considered using unused footage of Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises reunited Nolan with many of his 
		past collaborators, including cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Lee Smith, costume designer Lindy Hemming, 
		special effects supervisors Paul Franklin and Chris Corbould, and composer Hans Zimmer.

		In June 2013, Warner Bros. announced that director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer would return for a Man of Steel sequel, 
		with the studio considering the release for the film in 2015. The following month, Snyder confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con International that the 
		sequel to Man of Steel would feature Superman and Batman meeting for the first time on film. Goyer and Snyder would co-write the story, with Goyer 
		authoring the script, and Christopher Nolan involved in an advisory role as executive producer. According to Snyder, the film would take inspiration 
		from the comic The Dark Knight Returns.
		In November 2013, Snyder clarified his film would not be based upon the aforementioned graphic novel. "If you were going to do that, you would need a 
		different Superman. We're bringing Batman into the universe that now this Superman lives in." Batman v Superman marks the first appearance of Wonder Woman 
		in a live-action, theatrical film, which Warner Bros. had been developing as far back as 1996. In December 2013, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite the script, 
		due to Goyer's commitments to other projects. Further commenting on the influences, Terrio revealed in an article published by the Wall Street Journal that the 
		movie would draw inspiration from Nolan's Batman trilogy, Italian semiotician Umberto Eco's 1972 essay "The Myth of Superman", and the W.H. Auden poem "Musee 
		des Beaux Arts" which contrasts the quotidian details of normal people's lives with the epic struggles of mythological figures. According to him, "In superhero 
		stories, Batman is Pluto, god of the underworld, and Superman is Apollo, god of the sky. That began to be really interesting to me — that their conflict is not 
		just due to manipulation, but their very existence." The Joker and the Riddler were supposed to appear in the film, but Snyder ultimately decided to cut them 
		from the final script.
		The film's official title, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was revealed in May 2014. Snyder stated that having the "v" in the title instead of "vs." 
		was a way "to keep it from being a straight 'versus' movie, even in the most subtle way". Henry Cavill later stated, "I wouldn't call this a Superman sequel .
		 This is Batman versus Superman. It's a separate entity altogether. It's introducing the Batman character and expanding upon the universe, which was kicked 
		 off by Man of Steel." Forbes noted that although the film originated as a sequel to Man of Steel, it was "revamped into a backdoor pilot for Justice League 
		 and/or an eventual stand-alone Batman movie." As part of a settlement with his heirs, this is the first Batman production that features Bill Finger as a 
		 co-creator.
